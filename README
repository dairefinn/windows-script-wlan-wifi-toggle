# Windows network adaptor toggle script
My mobile hotspot is much faster than my wired connection.
This script is used to quickly toggle between the two.

I cannot rely solely on enabling wifi and disabling it as programs already using the wired adapter will continue using it.

This script will disable disable one and enable the other to ensure that programs switch over to the new connection.
