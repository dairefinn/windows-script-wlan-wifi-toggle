# Windows network adaptor toggle script
My mobile hotspot is much faster than my wired connection but my wired connection is much more reliable so I usually use the hotspot to download large files and then switch back to the wired connection for everything else.

The problem is that I cannot rely solely on enabling wifi and disabling it as programs already using the wired adapter will continue using it.

This script is used to quickly toggle between the two connections, ensuring that all programs switch over to the new connection.
